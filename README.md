# Transit Riding Simulation

The simulation is a commute between a model ‘home’ location (1315 Cleveland Ave N, St Paul, MN 55108) and a model ‘work’ location (Code 42, 100 Washington Square, 100 Washington Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55401). This simulation compares the estimated time it would take to commute based on Transit schedule data versus a person actually commuting on that route. To accomplish this, I asked the Google Maps Directions API to give commuting options 12 hours before a scheduled commute. This allows Google to return about 3 to 6 possible route options that include walking, transfers, and GTFS schedule-based transit times. Then at commute time the simulation attempts each of the returned routes at the same time, riding all route options from start to finish. To track progress on a route, I use the NexTrip API to track live locations transit buses. If a bus comes within 500 feet to a stop, we know it has arrived and the simulation can ‘ride’ it along the route until it reaches our destination stop. When generating routes, Google recommends different start times to reduce waiting at the first stop. I performed the simulation for each recommended route twice, once for an ‘immediate’ departure and once for Google’s recommended ‘scheduled’ departure’. This can be used to compare if leaving ahead of time might catch a transit line early.
